# My Startup Ideas (More than 2 cents)
Simple list of possible ideas for startups in different verticals.

### Health

1. Using Apple Watch or any other watch device capable of getting some metrics we could monitor the health conditions from the user and offer those data to the Health Insurance company. The benefit for the company is a more reliable profile scan than the ones they use today. On the other hand, the benefit for the user would be discounts at the insurance as well as a more personalized relationship with the insurance company.



_PS_ : I didn't run an extension search on the web to check if some of those ideas are products already, if you are a creator of a product that does what I suggested here, please, don't think I am trying to get credit for your creation neither I will be any kind of competitor. The list above is just free ideas to exercise the brain.
